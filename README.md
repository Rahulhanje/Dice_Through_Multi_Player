# Dice Game

Welcome to the Dice Game! This simple web application allows two players to roll dice and determine the winner. The game refreshes with each dice roll.

## Overview

This project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that work together to create a fun and interactive dice game.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage, including the button and other elements.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for rolling the dice and determining the winner.
- `images/`: Folder containing dice images (`dice_1.png`, `dice_2.png`, ..., `dice_6.png`).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure the dice images (`dice_1.png`, `dice_2.png`, etc.) are placed inside the `images` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## How to Play

1. Click the "Throw Dice" button to roll the dice.
2. The dice images for Player 1 and Player 2 will update based on the random dice rolls.
3. The result ("Player 1 Own", "Player 2 Own", or "Draw Match") will be displayed at the top of the page.

## Customization

- **Styling**: Modify the `style.css` file to change background colors, fonts, and button styles.
- **Game Logic**: Adjust the logic in `index.js` for different win conditions or additional game features.
